# Real Estate Price Prediction using LASSO Regression â€“ Python

Welcome to my project on Real Estate Price Prediction using LASSO Regression in Python! In this project, I focused on analyzing the housing dataset of Mumbai City, which included various factors such as the price of the estate, area, location, number of rooms, and amenities offered.

To ensure accurate predictions, I began by thoroughly cleaning the dataset and removing any outliers that could potentially affect the results. I also applied normalization techniques to standardize the data and make it suitable for training the model.

The next step involved splitting the dataset into a training set and a testing set. I used 80% of the data for training the LASSO regression model, which is a linear regression technique that performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance prediction accuracy. The remaining 20% of the data was utilized to evaluate the model's performance.

After training the model and conducting the necessary testing, I achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 81.67% in predicting the prices of real estate properties. This indicates that the LASSO regression algorithm was effective in capturing the relationships between the input variables and the housing prices in Mumbai City.

Overall, this project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques, specifically LASSO regression, to predict real estate prices. The accurate predictions obtained can assist potential buyers, sellers, and investors in making informed decisions regarding property transactions in Mumbai City.
