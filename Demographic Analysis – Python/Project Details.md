# Demographic Analysis â€“ Python

The Python project I undertook focused on performing a comprehensive demographic analysis of various countries. Leveraging the power of web scraping and data manipulation, I extracted pertinent information from Wikipedia using the BeautifulSoup library. By collecting relevant demographic data, I aimed to gain insights into the population characteristics of different countries.

To initiate the project, I utilized Python's web scraping capabilities through the BeautifulSoup library to extract data from Wikipedia pages. I targeted specific Wikipedia articles containing demographic information for countries worldwide. This enabled me to gather data points such as population size, birth and death rates, literacy rates, and other relevant statistics.

After successfully retrieving the data, I proceeded to clean and preprocess it to ensure accuracy and consistency. By employing various techniques in data cleaning and transformation, I addressed missing values, removed outliers, and standardized the dataset. This step was crucial to ensure the reliability of subsequent analyses.

To gain a better understanding of the collected data, I employed basic data visualization techniques. Utilizing Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, I created visual representations of the demographic trends and patterns observed across different countries. These visualizations included bar graphs, line charts, and scatter plots, enabling easy comprehension and comparison of the demographic indicators.

Overall, this Python project allowed me to delve into the realm of data acquisition, cleaning, and visualization, culminating in a comprehensive demographic analysis of various countries. By leveraging web scraping, data cleaning, and visualization techniques, I gained valuable insights into the population dynamics and characteristics of different nations.
