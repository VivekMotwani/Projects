# Uber Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Python

In the Python project focused on analyzing the Uber Data Set, I conducted an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover various factors influencing Uber trips. The dataset encompassed trip start time, end time, category, starting point, miles traveled, and purpose of the trip. Through this analysis, I aimed to answer several key questions and gain insights into the patterns and trends within the data.

Firstly, I examined the duration of people's trips to understand the average length of rides. Additionally, I investigated the hour during which people tend to travel the most, shedding light on peak usage periods. To gain a deeper understanding of users' intentions, I delved into the purpose of each trip and identified common reasons for Uber usage.

To determine the most popular day for travel, I analyzed the frequency of trips across different days. Furthermore, I explored the number of trips taken on a daily basis within a month, providing a comprehensive view of travel patterns over time. Additionally, I identified the most common boarding point, uncovering the primary location from which users embarked on their journeys.

Lastly, I compared the purpose of trips with other variables such as miles traveled, hour of the day, day of the month, day of the week, and month, along with the total travel time. By examining these relationships, I gained valuable insights into the factors influencing trip characteristics.

Through this project, I successfully completed a thorough EDA of the Uber Data Set, providing a comprehensive understanding of the various aspects influencing Uber trips. The conclusions drawn from this analysis offer valuable insights that can be used for further decision-making and optimization in the context of Uber's operations.
