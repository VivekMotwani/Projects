# Elective Bidding System - Python

Welcome to my Elective Bidding System Projects, this project was done as a part of solving a real life problem of alloting electives in most colleges.

While chosing electivies most colleges roll out a form to fill out preferences and allot it on First Come First Serve basis, but this also creates an issues that if any any kid due to any issue couldn't fill up the form at the starting, he/she might end up getting an elective which he doesn't deserve.

To overcome this issue I build up this Elective Bidding System, where every student based on their CGPA gets virtual money to bid on the elective, and whoever bids the most on that elective gets it
