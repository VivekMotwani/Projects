# Covid 19 India Data Visualization â€“ Power BI

In this project, I leveraged the power of Power BI to visualize and analyze the trends of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries.

To start, we utilized Power Query in Power BI for the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process. This involved gathering relevant COVID-19 data from reliable sources, cleansing and transforming it into a format suitable for analysis.

Next, using a combination of pre-existing measures and deriving new ones, we enriched the data to provide additional insights. These measures allowed us to calculate various metrics, such as the daily growth rate, mortality rate, and recovery rate. By employing these calculations, we were able to highlight the severity of the pandemic, identify areas with the highest fatality rates, and monitor the progress of recovery efforts.

With the prepared and enriched data, we constructed visually engaging and interactive dashboards using Power BI's robust visualization capabilities. Through intuitive charts, graphs, and maps, users can explore the COVID-19 trends, compare different states, and track changes over time. This visual representation not only simplifies complex data but also empowers decision-makers with actionable information to allocate resources effectively and implement targeted interventions.

Overall, our Power BI project on visualizing COVID-19 trends served as a valuable tool in understanding the evolving impact of the pandemic at the state level. By combining the ETL capabilities of Power Query, the analytical power of measures, and the visually stunning dashboards in Power BI, we provided a comprehensive and insightful view of the COVID-19 landscape, facilitating data-driven decision-making in response to the crisis.
