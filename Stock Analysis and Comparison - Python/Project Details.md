# Stock Analysis and Comparison - Python

The main aim of this project was to first compare two stocks (which user gives) using ANOVA on differnet parameters namely:
1. Trade Quantity
2. Trade Value
3. Total Trades
4. Volume
5. Dividents
6. Stock Split
   etc

After performing this comparision I then predict the movement of the next day, 1(UP) or 0(DOWN) using Logistic Regression and validated it using KFold Method
